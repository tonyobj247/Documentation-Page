HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundation of the web. It is a markup language that is used to create the structure and layout (design) of web pages. HTML being the most fundamental building block of the web, provides the structure and content of websites and is used in conjunction with other languages such as CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive websites. HTML is the first step in creating a website, and it's important to understand how it works.

HTML uses a set of tags, also known as elements, to create the structure of a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are used to define the different sections of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

One of the most important tags in HTML is the <html> tag, which defines the start and end of an HTML document. Within the <html> tag, there are two other important tags: the <head> tag and the <body> tag. The <head> tag contains information about the web page, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar, and meta tags, which provide information about the web page to search engines. The <body> tag contains the content of the web page, such as text, images, and links.

HTML also includes a wide range of other tags that can be used to create different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, tables, and forms. These tags allow web developers to create structured, well-formatted pages that are easy to read and navigate.

HTML5, the latest version of HTML, includes new tags and attributes that make it easier to create more interactive and dynamic websites. For example, the <video> and <audio> tags can be used to embed video and audio content directly on a web page, without the need for a separate plugin. Additionally, the <canvas> tag allows developers to create interactive graphics and animations using JavaScript.

Another important aspect of HTML is semantics, which is the practice of using HTML tags in a way that describes the meaning of the content they contain. This is important for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). For example, using the <h1> tag for a main heading and <p> tag for paragraphs is semantically correct, it helps users to understand the structure and hierarchy of the content, and it also helps search engines to understand the structure of the page.

Introduction


Getting Started
To start programming with HTML, you need a text editor and a web browser. You can use any text editor, but some popular choices include Notepad++, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio Code. For this training manual, we will be using Visual Studio Code. You can download Visual Studio Code from the official website.

Creating a New HTML File
To create a new HTML file, follow these steps:

Open Visual Studio Code.
Click on "File" in the top menu.
Click on "New File".
Save the file with a .html extension (e.g. index.html).
Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document has a basic structure that consists of the following elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Content of the document......
  </body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html> - This is the document type declaration, and it tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
<html> - This is the root element of an HTML document.
<head> - This element contains information about the document, such as the title, meta tags, and links to stylesheets.
<title> - This element specifies the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
<body> - This element contains the visible content of the document, such as text, images, and other HTML elements.
Creating a Title for Your Web Page
To create a title for your web page, follow these steps:

Open your HTML document in Visual Studio Code.
Locate the <head> element.
Inside the <head> element, add the <title> element.
Type the title of your web page between the opening and closing <title> tags.
For example:

<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
Adding Content to Your Web Page
To add content to your web page, follow these steps:

Open your HTML document in Visual Studio Code.
Locate the <body> element.
Inside the <body> element, add the content you want to display on your web page.
For example:

<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page. I'm so excited to learn HTML!</p>
</body>
In this example, we added a heading (<h1>) and a paragraph (<p>) to the body of our web page.

Adding Images to Your Web Page
To add images to your web page, follow these steps:

Save the image you want to use in the same directory as your HTML document.
Open your HTML document in Visual Studio Code.
Locate the <body> element.
Inside the <body> element, add the <img> element.
Set the "src" attribute of the <img> element to the file name of your image.
For example:

<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page. I'm so excited to learn HTML!</p>
  <img src="myimage.jpg">
</body>

In this example, we added an image to our web page using the <img> element and the "src" attribute.
